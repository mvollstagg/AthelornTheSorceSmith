  description: A mace with spikes is a brutal weapon that delivers crushing blows.
    It consists of a metal shaft with a spiked head, designed to penetrate armor
    and cause devastating injuries. Its intimidating appearance can strike fear into
    the hearts of enemies, and it's a favorite weapon of powerful warriors. Wielding
    a mace with spikes requires great strength and skill, but those who can master
    it become unstoppable forces on the battlefield.
