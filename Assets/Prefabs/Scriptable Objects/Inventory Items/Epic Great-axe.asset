  description: The Great-Axe is a mighty two-handed weapon, capable of dealing massive
    damage in a single strike. It requires strength and skill to wield, and its weight
    makes it slower than other weapons. But when swung with enough force, it can
    cleave through armor and bones alike, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.
